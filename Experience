I thoroughly enjoyed finishing this take-home test. Unfortunately, I didn't have any time last week. It was a relatively easy test to solve. If these are the tasks I will be working on most days, it will be entertaining. I had an issue with my Python installation, so I spent about 40 minutes looking at different files within the Docker image to see if they were the problem. My initial thoughts were maybe this is the test that I figure out why the sqs isn't working.  I couldn't initially receive the SQS messages from my local host. However, I looked at the instructions again, then uninstalled Python and reinstalled it. The ETL process was straightforward once I could set it up correctly, flattening the JSON and reading from SQS. The biggest issue I faced was trying to fix the version number. The DDL specified that it had to be an integer. My first thought would be to alter the column, add another column, or create a smaller table mapping version numbers to user IDs, but I tried a different approach. This was fun. Fix and improve this if possible.
